## Insight  

  Since the api gives back a list of video and its information,
  an intuitive way to consume it would be having a video list on the page,
  providing a twiter/facebook timeline-like scroll experience.

  Besides scrolling, it will be great if users could discover what they want by sorting and filtering the list.
  Number of 'likes', 'plays', 'comments' could be used as sorting index, and its tags could be used for filtering.


## Feature

 * lazy load

 * sort and filter

 * pause video if it's not in visible area on the page


## QA

 *  Was the question/problem clear? did you feel like something was missing or not explained correctly?

 *  How much time did you spend on each part: understanding, designing, coding, testing?

  understanding: 
  designing:
  coding:
  testing:

 *  What would you have done differently if you have more time or resources?


 *  Are there any bottlenecks with your solution? if so, what are they and what can you do to fix them/minimize their impact?
  filter!

 *  How would the system scale for more users/visitors?


 *  How would your solution cope if the api was slow or broke or returned incorrect data?
 *  Anything else you want to share about your solution or the problem?
