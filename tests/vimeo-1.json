Travel to the edge of the earth to see one of the planet’s rarest events- a total solar eclipse in the Arctic. Faced with the likely reality of bad weather obscuring the sun and having to battle frigid, arctic temperatures and winds, the odds did not favor success. Despite this the Salomon Freeski TV team and set out on an expedition to realize photographer, Reuben Krabbe’s grand vision to capture a single unique image- one of skiing during a solar eclipse. Persistence, preparation and a positive attitude was a guarantee of nothing as March 20th, 2015, dawned. The fate of the expedition’s goal would rest entirely in the hands of the weather gods.",

Growing up in the Los Angeles area, he was always aware of the invisibility of the area's domestic laborers. Now, as an artist represented by the Charlie James Gallery, Gomez paints these workers and places their figures in scenes of L.A. luxury. \"It's my interest to showcase the other side of things, the more real side that I see, which is the people maintaining those mansions,\" he says in this documentary produced by Kelly Loudenberg for The Atlantic's American Dreams series. \"I hope that these paintings showcase that their labor meant something to me and it meant something to society.\"",

How did we get here?”*<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the summer of 2015, Eva Verbeeck asked me to join her on a trip throughout the Pacific Northwest to produce a short film on young farmers that would accompany her photo story for a variety of publications. Having spent much time WWOOFing on organic farms, I knew the importance of this mission. So we loaded our iPods with old bluegrass music and set off in a 1990 Nissan truck, heading from Portland to British Columbia. We offered our labor in exchange for room and board at the farms that we made it to.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis film is an attempt to express some of the thoughts and feelings of the young farmers that we stayed with. Hopefully a little bit of justice was done for all the young farmers out there.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInfinite gratitude to all of the farms that hosted us this summer and kept us filled with organic produce and warmth:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Earth Candy Farm (facebook.com/earthcandyfarms)<br />\r\n- Plenty Wild Farms (www.plentywild.ca)<br />\r\n- Skyberry Farm (www.skyberryfarm.com)<br />\r\n- Hoe Down CSA at Tulaberry Farm (www.hoedowncsa.wordpress.com)<br />\r\n- Yummy Yards (www.yummyyards.ca)<br />\r\n- Growing Veterans (www.growingveterans.org)<br />\r\n- Beacon Food Forest (www.beaconfoodforest.org)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe farmers narrating this film (in order of appearance):<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Claire Jutras (Earth Candy Farm)<br />\r\n- Alyssa Belter (Plenty Wild Farms)<br />\r\n- Kate Rustemeyer (Hoe Down CSA at Tulaberry Farm)<br />\r\n- Ellis Hroch (Earth Candy Farm)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMusic:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Black Twig Pickers and Steve Gunn - \"Old Strange\" (CC Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 International License)<br />\r\n- Chris Zabriskie - \"Another Version of You\" (Licensed CC-BY)<br />\r\n- Nicolas Jaar/Vera Remember - Essential Mix/Last Night Together<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEquipment used:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Panasonic GH4 and 14-45 3.5-5.6 native lens.<br />\r\n- Occasional tripod usage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDirected/Edited by Spencer MacDonald (halfmagicfilms.com)<br />\r\nProduced/Masterminded by Eva Verbeeck (evaverbeeck.com)<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis doc was made for love, not for money.
